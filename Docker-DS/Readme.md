**Vehicle Count using DeepSORT**

- Project Overview

This Git repository contains the source code and resources for a Vehicle Counting system implemented using the DeepSORT (Deep Learning Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm. DeepSORT is a state-of-the-art object tracking algorithm that can be used to track vehicles in real-time video streams.

+ Features
-Real-time vehicle tracking and counting.
-Integration with deep learning models for vehicle detection (MobilenetSSDv3).
-Highly accurate object tracking using the DeepSORT algorithm.
-Visualization tools for tracking results.
-Configurable parameters for customization.
-Logging and reporting capabilities.

+ To experiment with it, try modifying the values in the function **draw_rectangle** located in deep_sort/application_util/visualization.py.
