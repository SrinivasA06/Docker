**Vehicle Count using DeepSORT**

- Project Overview

This Git repository contains the source code and resources for a Vehicle Counting system implemented using the DeepSORT (Deep Learning Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm. DeepSORT is a state-of-the-art object tracking algorithm that can be used to track vehicles in real-time video streams.

1. Features
-Real-time vehicle tracking and counting.
-Integration with deep learning models for vehicle detection (MobilenetSSDv3).
-Highly accurate object tracking using the DeepSORT algorithm.
-Visualization tools for tracking results.
-Configurable parameters for customization.
-Logging and reporting capabilities.

2. Requirements: 
1. Python 3
2. Tensorflow=2.10.1
3. opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16
4. opencv-python==4.8.0.76
